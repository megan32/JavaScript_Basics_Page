        <p id="mainP"> Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaSCript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a smlal and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
        <ul class="mainPoints">
          <li><span class="link">Variable Declaration</span> JavasScript variable are containers for storing data values - imagin a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coofee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span class="specialText"> var x </span></li>
          <li><span class="link">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables -our cup can now have coffee oured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span class="specialText"> var x = 10;</span></li>
          <li><span class="link">Data Types</span> Data types are an importnat concept; to be able to operate on variable you need to konw the data type. There are six data types taht are JavaScript primitives; Boolean - <span class="specialText">true</span> or <span class="specialText">false;</span> null <span class="specialText">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="specialText">42</span> or <span class="specialText"> 3.14159;</span> String -<span class="specialText">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="specialText">[1, 'Coding', 2, "Dojo"]; </span> and Object - <span class="specialText">{first_name: "Jane", last_name: "Doe"}</span> </li>
          <li><span class="link">Conditionals</span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisiosn -hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional states:<span class="specialText">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="specialText">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="specialText">else</span> we execute this block of code; </li>
          <li> <span class="link">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </li>
          <li> <span class="link">Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our fnction this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting togehter a desk from Ikea, we open up the isnturciton manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tbales to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
